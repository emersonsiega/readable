# Readable Project

**Readable** is the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course.  
It's a reddit clone that lets users post, comment and vote in any content posted in. Also, it's possible to edit, delete and sort posts and comments.

## Getting started
**Install and start the API server**  
```
cd api-server
yarn install
yarn start
```

**In another terminal window, install and start the front-end**  
```
cd frontend
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Demo
You can see a live demo [here](http://udacityreadable.surge.sh/)    
_maybe the server need some seconds to start, because of inactivity_

**Prototype**  
I've _tried_ to follow [this](https://www.figma.com/proto/D2WFh6tJn9irG5V1VJNGgk9s/readable?node-id=6%3A260&scaling=contain&redirected=1) prototype, made by myself.  
_Don't judge me, it's first time I've used Figma and I'm not a **good** designer_


## API Server  
Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).
